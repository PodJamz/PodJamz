## 👋 Hey, I’m James

I’m a **creative technologist and founder** based in Ireland.  
I build systems where **imagination meets execution**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- software engineering  
- product design  
- AI-native workflows  
- and experimental interfaces

Right now we’re entering what I call the **Token Allocation Era**:  
a phase where intelligence is abundant, tools are absurdly powerful, and the real constraint is *taste, clarity, and intent*.

I spend my time turning high-level ideas into **real, usable systems**.  
Less theory. More shipped reality.

## 🧠 The Token Allocation Era

<div align="center">
  <p><em>“When intelligence becomes abundant, direction becomes the scarce resource.”</em></p>
</div>

We’re no longer limited by *whether* something can be built.  
We’re limited by:
- what deserves to exist
- how well it’s shaped
- and who it actually helps

That’s the space I work in.
